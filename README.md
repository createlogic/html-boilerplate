Boilerplate Template
=====

This boilerplate template is a port from the [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate). However it has been customized as per some of the architectural requirements as default for most of my projects & as per the [Front-end Development Guidelines ](https://github.com/createlogic/Web-Front-end-Development-Guidelines).

##Features

- HTML5 ready. Use the new elements with confidence.
- Cross-browser compatible (Chrome, Firefox, IE8+, Opera, Safari).
- Includes a port of [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/) mixed together with [reset.css](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) for CSS normalizations, reset & common bug fixes.
- The latest jQuery via CDN, with a local fallback.
- The latest Modernizr build for feature detection.
- Placeholder CSS Media Queries.
- Default print CSS, performance optimized.
- Protection against any stray console.log causing JavaScript errors in older browsers.
- An optimized Google Analytics snippet.
- Easy to strip out parts you don't need.
- Extensive inline and accompanying documentation.


##Documentation
The [documentation](docs/intro.md) about the boilerplate provides in depth details on the different components of the boilerplate and how they fit together.
